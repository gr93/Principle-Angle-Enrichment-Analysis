    This is a tool for doing Principle Angle Enrichment Analysis. PAEA utilizes a geometric approach to gene set enrichment, employing dimensionality
    reduction and a multivariate approach that is an improvement upon the characteristic direction. It was found that this approach outperformed GSEA, the chi-squared test, the median p value test, the
    Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results were verified from a set of controlled experiments from which we can expect a
    subset of genes to be significantly different from a randomly sampled gene set from the gene set library. The ranks and cumulative distribution
    function (cdf's) were analyzed to determine which method performed the best. <br> <br>

    This tool utilizes an R-package called which is able to perform characteristic direction analysis as well as principle angle enrichment analysis.
    It takes expression data, the sample classes, and gamma value parameters as inputs, and outputs three graphs. The first graph is a 2D projection of the
    characteristic direction (Principle Component 2 vs Principle Component 1). Typically this is used to reduce large gene data sets into a smaller number
    of principle components, from which we can make better conclusions. The second graph is a significance curve of significance vs rank values. Rank
    values are obtained by transposing the expression data matrix and ordering the values. From here, a significance test is conducted between the two
    groups (control vs perturbed) to obtain this graph. A positive peak indicates the two groups are significantly different. The final graph is a graph of
    the shrinkage parameter (gamma) versus significantly differentially expressed genes. This utilizes PAEA in order to give a stronger reading. <br> <br>

    To use this tool, please upload 3 files: expression data, sample class data, and gamma values. Additionally, three example files are provided here in
    order to try using this tool. <br> <br>
